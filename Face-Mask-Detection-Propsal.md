### Introduction 

The COVID 19 pandemic is causing a worldwide health crisis. Wearing a face mask in public places and wherever else is the most effective safety gear. In this project, we will build a deep learning model that recognizes persons wearing masks, people with no masks, and people wearing erroneous masks.
The constructed model will be CNN, which we will discover to be the best fit for our situation and for image detection.

### Approach
  Our plan in the project is to:
- Find data that meets our goal.
- Build a deep learning model(CNN).
- Build a classification model.
- Deploy a streamlit model.


### Data Description
The [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/vijaykumar1799/face-mask-detection) contains 3 folders labeled as to which class they belong to. the 3 classes are "withmask", "withoutmask", and "maskwearedincorrect". Each folder holds **2994** images of people who belong to such a labeled class with total of **8982** images.
